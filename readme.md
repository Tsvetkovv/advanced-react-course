# Advanced React & GraphQL

These are the starter files and stepped solutions for the [Advanced React & GraphQL](https://AdvancedReact.com) course by [Wes Bos](https://WesBos.com/).

The root package.json is used for running BE server.
To serve FE there is a `frontend` folder. It is made because heroku does not allow to run BE and FE simultaneously, so it is used only for running BE and Vercel runs FE.
